# Road to quant
 C++ projects that begin with Intro to C++ quizzes that were covered in Ohio State's C++ course with Dr. Wilcox.
 I want this repo to serve as a guide to anyone trying to learn C++ and wants material that can also be used as a supplement to their leanring journey. <br>
 Additionally, I named the repo this way as a joke in the beginning but I feel having a big goal serves as strong motivation in achieving your goals. <br>
All the best to those that see this. <br>
<br>
Yours, <br>
