# Road to Quant
 C++ projects that begin with Intro to C++ quizzes that were covered in Ohio State's C++ course. <br>
 I want this repo to serve as a guide to anyone trying to learn C++ and wants material that can also be used as a supplement to their learning journey. <br>
 I begin with the following:
<li>Quiz 1 - C++ Basics & Math Functions
<li>Quiz 2: Selection & loops
<li>Quiz 3 - Formatted I/O, const, and functions
<li>Quiz 4 - Numerical & arrays
<li>Quiz 5 - Strings, Vectors & pointers
<li>Quiz 6: Classes & pointers to classes
<li>Quiz 7: Reading & Writing to Files 
 <br>
Additionally, I named the repo this way as a joke in the beginning but I feel having a big goal serves as strong motivation in achieving your goals. <br>
 <br>
All the best to those that see this, <br>
