# Road to Quant: A Comprehensive C++ Learning Guide

Welcome to **Road to Quant**, a repository designed to serve as a guide for anyone learning C++ or seeking supplementary material for their journey. Inspired by the curriculum of Ohio State University's Intro to C++ course, this repository provides well-structured examples, quizzes, and solutions covering key C++ concepts.

Whether you're a student, a professional, or a self-learner, the goal of this repository is to help you master C++ concepts and build a solid foundation for more advanced programming challenges.

## Future Plans

To expand the value of this repository, I plan to include advanced C++ projects that showcase skills relevant to employers and demonstrate proficiency in modern software development. These projects will integrate the concepts learned in the quizzes and apply them to real-world challenges.

### Planned Projects:

1. **Expression Evaluator:**
   - A program to parse and evaluate Boolean expressions or mathematical formulas.

2. **Portfolio-Worthy Applications:**
   - Projects involving advanced data structures, simulations, or graphical interfaces that stand out to employers.

3. **Compiler Basics:**
   - Simple projects focused on parsing and interpreting code, such as creating a basic interpreter for a custom scripting language.

4. **Game Development:**
   - A small game project, such as a text-based RPG or a simplified version of Pok√©mon, to demonstrate object-oriented programming and creativity.
